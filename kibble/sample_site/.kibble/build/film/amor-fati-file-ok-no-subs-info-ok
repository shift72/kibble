With support from the flamboyant ‘star’ American journalist, Flynn (Woody Harrelson), and aid worker, Nina (Marisa Tomei), Henderson embarks on a perilous and terrifying journey to evacuate the city’s orphan children to safety.\nThe film is inspired by the true story of ITV news reporter Michael Nicholson, who after months of reporting on the siege of Sarajevo, smuggled a child out of the war-torn city and later adopted her.
