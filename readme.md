## Releasing new versions

Kibble is released to 3 places

  1. github - mostly historical purposes, intention is to make this open source
  2. SHIFT72 Platform - this is where the platform will pull the kibble release from
  3. NPM - to support installation for third parties via npm and the node js environment

``` bash

# a. update npm package version
#    kibble-npm/package.json

# b. ensure that the release is tagged correctly. Miss the prepended 'v' as this will mess S3 up.
git tag 0.9.6 master
git push origin 0.9.6

# c. build and release to locations 1 and 2
cd kibble
AWS_PROFILE=shift72a goreleaser --rm-dist

# d. release to location 3
cd kibble-npm
npm publish

# e. register new build in uber admin

# f. update any sample templates with the new kibble version

```
